# FVTT Custom Journal Theming - The Journals of your Dreams!

> **IF YOU ARE STILL ON 1.0.11 OR LOWER, YOU WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE TO REINSTALL MANUALLY, SINCE I MADE A MISTAKE IN THE MANIFEST LINK, BREAKING THE USUAL UPDATE PROCESS. SORRY ABOUT THE INCONVENIENCE!**

Welcome to your own personal playground to design your own wonderful-looking journals! 
Not only did I want to make journals more interesting, I also wanted to to allow them
to be selectively themed, much like actors can. This is now possible, with a current 
library of three themes in addition to the original Foundry look.

In addition to the regular reskin provided by the different themes, you can now also benefit from some other style options in the editor dropdown, such as drop caps (moved from defaulting to *every* paragraphs' first letter) and various text "boxes"! (*not supported by all themes)

## Known Issues

If you encounter any bug or want to suggest improvements, don't hesitate to tell me either 
here through the issues or on Discord (do tag me if reaching out through the Foundry Discord
if you want me to see your message @Sanyella#3760). Do take into account though that this is
still an early version which needs a lot more work. I'll do my best to fix these issues as 
fast as possible, but take note that it may still take a certain time before I have the time 
to fix something.

- **Bug**: The drop down for the "default" journal sheet doesn't currently work. I have yet to 
find out why, so please be patient. Rest assured, individual sheet themes *are* working.

- **Compatibility issue**: The button for MINDMAP doesn't show when using Custom Journal. There
is also a know issue with Data Toolbox.

*Theme-specific issues aren't going to be listed here, but will be available and appropriately 
tagged in the GitHub issues.*

## Personalizing your journals

If you want to customize the look of your journals, you can edit an existing theme,
you can simply tweak values, or you can create your own theme, following the instructions
in the styles/templates.css and the scripts/custom-journal.js files. Don't forget to add
any extra file you create to the module.json as well so it loads.

A final word of warning:
BE WARNED: Since there isn't any way to save changes made to a module from updates
(such as perhaps to introduce more themes), updating may mean ANY CHANGES YOU WOULD HAVE MADE WOULD BE LOST.

> **PLEASE BACKUP ANY CHANGES YOU WANT TO KEEP OUTSIDE OF THE MODULE TO SET THOSE BACK IN CASE OF A MODULE UPDATE.**

This is of course by no mean ideal, and I'll try to bring more themes natively to limit the 
need for individual creation of such themes, but I do understand many will probably still 
want to make their own, and as such I do try to guide you though it so my work can help you.
Provided they do not introduce fonts or textures I cannot distribute and they are of good quality,
I might also be open to adding your styles, if you so wish. Just reach out to me in Discord 
(Sanyella#3760) or right here if you're confident to submit a pull request.
